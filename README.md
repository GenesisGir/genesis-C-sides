An array of code snippets that I tossed in this repository that was just projects didn't make it to VOl.1 or VOL.2 etc. Here I'll be throwing in really nifty ideas that I just wanted to release and needed my practice, either way code snippers , snippets , cuts , refills , remixes of old code or orginal code will be passed onto here.

# breaking rules
With these code snippets being allowed to be whatever they become into Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 functionalities are allowed in these snippets or whole programs whatever they turn into! Find work that I delve into and let my imagination run wild this is just a repo of all the code snippets that run into my head but where never ment to make it into the volumes. Think of this repo of the place where all my practice and ideas come to flock and become what they are because writing whole programs and writers block hits me in these desperate times, enjoy the sides!
