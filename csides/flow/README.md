# repetition flow
This programs lets the user choose how many times they would like to call the number set by users input
the program uses the various functions set out. The use of importing modules are used as well and is being 
used to choose when the program should end with the sys.exit() function call that calls to the sys module
its really amazing what you can do with string concatanation and converters like str() that converts anything you enter 
within it into the string data type! check out this seaside its short and simple but ultimately we are using for
loops and functions to make this porject breathe life into the program. Parameters are being implemented also
its being used within the print line on line 30 to insert the phone_number constant into its parenthesis () and the
use of  functions are used in lines 24/31 to store the data and source code to be used anywhere in the code later on
this helps to have to copy/paste code over and over again!

# Learn , Discover , Explore!
In this .py you can learn alot from what I did and discover methods I use to make things work! This is very Novice level friendly
and if you find yourself lost just make sure to look at the comments next to the lines of code to see what each line does and why 
I added those functions and how they are being implmented. again this is very user friendly and very easy to understand I made
these projects so someone new to coding can learn and develop skills like I have to make their own programs and have somewhere to
start in the world of coding!

# Twitch
I also stream my progress on Twitch and store the broadcasts so subscribers can rewatch and see how i made them from scratch! I stream for hours
at a time and make sure to stop by and ask me any questions or , Chat , watch my progress!
