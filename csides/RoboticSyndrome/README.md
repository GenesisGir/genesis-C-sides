# Robotic Syndrome
 Robotic Syndrome takes the user to a room with a manic robot 
that makes them guess they right number 10 times if not user will end up perishing from the gigantic lazer that the robot
has in store for them! Guess the right number to survive if you guessed wrong you will know and find yourself out the
room filled with mechanical parts from the future met for your demise. Being locked inside of a room with no way out
like in life you only get one chance to live and it's the same for Robotic Syndrome

# Learn , Discover , Explore!
In this .py you can learn alot from what I did and discover methods I use to make things work! This is very Novice level friendly
and if you find yourself lost just make sure to look at the comments next to the lines of code to see what each line does and why 
I added those functions and how they are being implmented. again this is very user friendly and very easy to understand I made
these projects so someone new to coding can learn and develop skills like I have to make their own programs and have somewhere to
start in the world of coding!

# Twitch
I also stream my progress on Twitch and store the broadcasts so subscribers can rewatch and see how i made them from scratch! I stream for hours
at a time and make sure to stop by and ask me any questions or , Chat , watch my progress!
